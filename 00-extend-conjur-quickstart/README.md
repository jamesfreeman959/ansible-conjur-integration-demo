# Extending Conjur Quickstart

If you are working from the `conjur-quickstart` example, you can build/deploy these two simple containers to extend the Docker environment to run the Ansible integration examples on top of the same environment. The Docker images are pushed to Docker Hub, so simply run the containers as detailed in `run.sh`.

The SSH credentials for the `ansible-target` container are `root:password`.
